**Full Stack Developer | MERN Stack Enthusiast | Passionate Problem Solver**

With a background in computer science and extensive experience in full stack development, I specialize in creating dynamic web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). My journey includes roles as a Full Stack Developer at Decision Hub 360 and Claystone, where I honed my skills in building scalable solutions and collaborating on diverse projects.

I am proficient in modern web technologies, including TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and various frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind. My passion for coding extends to optimizing user experiences and ensuring robust performance across applications. When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring the latest in tech trends or contributing to open-source projects.
