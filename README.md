## Full Stack Developer | MERN Stack Enthusiast | Passionate Problem Solver

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a Full Stack Developer with a solid foundation in computer science and a knack for creating dynamic, scalable web applications. My expertise lies in the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—where I’ve built impactful solutions through roles at Decision Hub 360 and Claystone.

### What I Do

- **Frontend Development**: Crafting intuitive and responsive UIs with React.js, TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
- **Backend Development**: Building robust server-side solutions using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- **UI/UX**: Enhancing user experiences with modern design frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
- **DevOps & Deployment**: Leveraging tools such as Docker and AWS for seamless application deployment and management.

When I’m not immersed in code, I’m exploring the latest tech trends or contributing to open-source projects.
